# IMDB-Scraper

The imdb_scraper.ipynb source code extracts several features of movies from the IMDB website released between 2022-01-01 and 2022-12-31. It cleans the extracted features to make the collected dataset easy to use. The scraped features are movie, year, rating,	genre,	runtime,	imdb_rating,	metascore,	votes, and descriptions.   

The CSV file contains a list of 2000 movies extracted with this code. This dataset can be used in several MK tasks, such as NLP and more.
